Desires / reqs:

1.) Preferably separate layers for anything that's on a different z-index. I may add parallax to this, but at the very least I'll use separate layers for responsiveness.
 
2.) Visually some depth to the image. The deer cutout in the above works because I can add independent scrolling to the elements in the bubble. Ideas around this - multiple thought bubbles coming out of a creator, one has art, one has a writing, one has some music notes in it. I can use the thought bubbles as a mask and make the creations scroll differently to give it depth. 

3.) Ultra bonus points if you can create it in figma so I can export to an svg and make the colors responsive for light mode / dark mode. If this disrupts your approach to creation, then skip it, but if I recall you used to draw by manipulating bezier curves directly.
